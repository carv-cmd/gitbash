# GitHub over OpenSSH

Please read the [*OpenSSH documentation*](https://www.openssh.com/) if you plan to use it extensively.

A properly configured client and server are the first line of defense.

Configuration is dependant on the use case and the template provided here is just that.

---
### *Verify you have open-ssh installed.*
```bash
# Check upstream cache
apt-cache show ssh

# If `ssh` doesn't exist on your host install it.
if ! command -v ssh; then
    sudo apt-get install ssh
fi
```

## SSH Key Generation
**Generate an *id_ed25519* ssh-key-pair.**
* This can be done with [*`gitman users --keygen`*](bin/users.sh) (prints public key to upload).
* Or manually with the following steps.

**Either way you will be prompted for a few questions, notably the one asking for a *passphrase*.**
* If you set a *passphrase* you will be prompted for it every time you push/pull upstream.
* For that reason the *passphrase* may be left empty if security is not a concern.

**And SSH still needs its *~/.ssh/config* file created** 
* This is covered after **Manual Keygen**

---
### Manual Keygen
**Execute this command filling in your GitHub email after `-C`.**
```bash
man ssh-keygen
ssh-keygen -t id_ed25591 -C 'GITHUB_EMAIL@EMAIL.com'
```
**Two files should have been created in *~/.ssh/***
* *id_ed22519* - PRIVATE KEY. Keep this secure.
* *id_ed25519.pub* - PUBLIC KEY. Upload this to GitHub.
```bash
# PRIVATE KEY
>>> cat ~/.ssh/config/id_ed25519
--BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY--
 <LONG-RANDOM-ALNUM-STRING>
---END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY---
```
```bash
# PUBLIC KEY
>>> cat ~/.ssh/config/id_ed25519.pub
ssh-ed25519 <SHA-STRING> GITHUB_EMAIL@EMAIL.com 
```

## ~/.ssh/config
**The `~/.ssh/config` file *will not* be generated by default.**
* You will need to create it with `touch ~/.ssh/config`.
* If ~/.ssh/config does exist just append the `Host gh` record at the end.

**Setting `ControlMaster`, `ControlPath`, `ControlPersist` will reuse the SSH connection.**
* If you have slower internet or work alot with upstreams this may help speed up workflows.

---
*Copy into ~/.ssh/config*
```txt
Host *
    ForwardAgent no
    ForwardX11 no
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
    Port 22
    Protocol 2
    VisualHostKey yes
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    LogLevel INFO

# Test w/ `ssh -T gh`
Host gh
    Hostname github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    # Reuse connection, persist( 1h ).
    # ControlMaster auto
    # ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%r@%h:%p.socket
    # ControlPersist 1h
```
*Configuration Help*
```bash
# OpenSSH Documentation: [ https://www.openssh.com/ ]

# SSH Manual
man ssh

# SSH Client config (outgoing)
man ssh_config

# SSH Server config (incoming)
man sshd_config
```

## Configure the GH-CLI to use SSH
You will need to modify "~/.config/gh/config.yml".
* This can be done with your favorite text editor or the `sed` command below.
```bash
# Locate Record -> git_protocol: [ if 'https' replace with 'ssh' ]
(vim||nano) ~/.config/gh/config.yml

# Dryrun without [-i] first. Modifies inplace.
if cat ~/.config/gh/config.yml; then
    sed [-i] 's/^git_protocol: https/git_protocol: ssh/' ~/.config/gh/config.yml
fi
```
---
## Existing Remotes
Remote URL formats:
* `https://github.com/GIT_USER/GIT_REPO.git`
* `git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git`

If you cloned a repository with *HTTPS* change its remote to *SSH* with the following.
```bash
# You must be in a git repo to check its remotes
cd ~/local-git-repo

# Check remote URL's known to ~/local-git-repo
if git remote -v; then
    
    # Change remote URL's like so
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
    
    # Check new remote URL's    
    git remote -v
fi
```

## SSH-Agent
If you created "~/.ssh/config" file I dont think this is required.
* If you're having problems try this then `ssh -T gh`
```bash
# Start ssh-agent in background
ssh-agent -s
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add private key to ssh-agent, (prompts for passphrase if key has one)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25591
```
